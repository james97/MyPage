                      ABSTRACT:  In the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) techniques, there exists standard test collections that
                      allow cross-comparisons for different techniques. However, according to Armstrong et
                      al.'s survey, there is little evidence of overall improvement in ad-hoc retrieval
                      technology since 1998. Although the published experiments often report significant
                      improvements for the newly proposed models, the baselines are generally weak and often
                      below the median original TREC system. In this paper, we propose a hybrid retrieval
                      model, in which we incorporate different state-of-the-art methods to boost the overall performance. Our model is simple, but effective.
                      The experimental results show that our model outperforms the best TREC systems in most
                      cases. It indicates that our model can be used as a better baseline when evaluating a
                      newly proposed technique.

                      ABSTRACT: Rocchio's relevance feedback model is a classic query expansion method and it has been shown
                      to be effective in boosting information retrieval performance.
                      The selection of expansion terms in this method, however, does not take into account the
                      relationship between the candidate terms and the query terms (e.g., term proximity).
                      Intuitively, the proximity between candidate expansion terms and query terms
                      can be exploited in the process of query expansion, since terms closer to query
                      terms are more likely to be related to the query topic.
                      
                      In this paper, we study how to incorporate proximity information into the Rocchio's model,
                      and propose a proximity-based Rocchio's model, called PRoc, with three variants.
                      In our PRoc models, a new concept (proximity-based term frequency, ptf) is introduced to model the proximity information in the pseudo relevant documents,
                      which is then used in three kinds of proximity measures.
                      Experimental results on TREC collections show that our proposed PRoc models are effective and generally superior to
                      the state-of-the-art relevance feedback models with optimal parameters.
                      A direct comparison with positional relevance model (PRM) on the GOV2 collection
                      also indicates our proposed model is at least competitive to the most recent progress.

                      ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present our participation in the Medical Records Track of TREC 2011. The goal of this track is to develop quick search and retrieval tools that are useful for physicians for the purpose to find patients that have similar diseases and/or treatments. To achieve this goal, we propose query expansion and semantic matching models using semantic medical ontologies for medical data retrieval. The query expansion utilizes a medical disease dictionary that presents different possible reformulations given the query disease keywords. For the semantic matching model, we employed BioLabler, a medical annotation tool that  allows indexing of queries and documents with  UMLS concepts of our choosing. Moreover, the matching model consists of ranking the documents that contain the query concepts according to their scores in the document.  We also evaluate  a traditional  weighting  model (BM25),  query expansion using relevance  feedback  under Rocchio's feedback framework and the impact of genre and age filtering,  proximity and co-occurrence between  disease keywords and procedure/intervention keywords on the retrieval performance.

                      ABSTRACT: 
                      <p>BACKGROUND:The users desire to be provided short, specific answers to questions and put them in context by linking original sources from the biomedical literature. Through the use of information retrieval technologies, information systems retrieve information to index data based on all kinds of pre-defined searching techniques/functions such that various ranking strategies are designed depending on different sources. In this paper, we propose a robust approach to optimizing multi-source information for improving genomics retrieval performance.</p>
                      <p>RESULTS:
                      In the proposed approach, we first consider a common scenario for a metasearch system that has access to multiple baselines with retrieving and ranking documents/passages by their own models. Then, given selected baselines from multiple sources, we investigate three modified fusion methods in the proposed approach, reciprocal, CombMNZ and CombSUM, to re-rank the candidates as the outputs for evaluation. Our empirical study on both 2007 and 2006 genomics data sets demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach for obtaining better performance. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the reciprocal method provides notable improvements on the individual baseline, especially on the passage2-level MAP and the aspect-level MAP.</p>
                      <p>CONCLUSIONS:
                      From the extensive experiments on two TREC genomics data sets, we draw the following conclusions. For the three fusion methods proposed in the robust approach, the reciprocal method outperforms the CombMNZ and CombSUM methods obviously, and CombSUM works well on the passage2-level when compared with CombMNZ. Based on the multiple sources of DFR, BM25 and language model, we can observe that the alliance of giants achieves the best result. Meanwhile, under the same combination, the better the baseline performance is, the more contribution the baseline provides. These conclusions are very useful to direct the fusion work in the field of biomedical information retrieval.</p>

                      to propose a multi-source fusion approach for improving information retrieval performance. First, we consider a common

                      by their own models. Second, given selected baselines from

                      the proposed approach, reciprocal and combMNZ, to rerank the candidates as the output for evaluation. Third, our

                      demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach to better
                      performance fusion. Fourth, the experimental results show that

                      University in Canada for the KIS (Known-item search) task of TRECVID 2010. This is the first time that we participate in the TRECVID. With rich experience in text retrieval, we mainly focus on the meta information of videos, and try to figure out the importance of these description corpus. In order to obtain this goal, we do not use any video or audio technologies. Only text retrieval methods are utilized to find the know items. Traditional weighting models in text retrieval like BM25 and Lemur TF-IDF are used. Meanwhile, we also use query expansion methods to improve the performance. However, the results are not promising. We make a further discussion about the reason at the end of this paper.
